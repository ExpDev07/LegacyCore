# LegacyCore
By ExpDev, Discord: Marius Big Ounce#2997

### ESX sux
Let's face it. ESX is a broken pile of shit. It laggs and breaks all the time, even the original author said that it was only a 1-week project to learn about Lua and FiveM. And since I've been writing
OOP in Java for 5 years, I thought I'd give a shot at making a "core" in C# which will give a lot of base [administrative] functionality (permissions, commands, groups, chat, etc...) to upcoming projects and 
at the same time cover all the RP-ing aspects ESX does. I know this is a long shot in the dark, and by no means consider this "official" or close to completed, but please, feel free to make push requests
and give suggestions.

### The Name
I choose LegacyCore because LegacyRP is the first server I ever played at, and I have to admit, this is sorta an attempt to have the server transfer over to this. I am doing this for free and will accept
no payments/donations, and if you decide to contribute, I hope you will neither.

Happy coding!
